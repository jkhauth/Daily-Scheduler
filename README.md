            <p> For this application, its functionality is that you dont lose track of your daily schedule. You will also see that when the time goes throughout the day, the shading of the hour blocks will change. If it is a past time or event, the hour block will be grey. If they event is taken place at that give time, the hour block changes to red. If it is a future event, you can then see that it is highlighted in green.
			<br>
			You can select a given time block, type out the event and simply click the save icon. When this is executed, the daily scheduler saves your task and keeps it in the hour block that you assigned it.
